Durka is a Unity game featuring a procedural 3D dungeon generation system inspired by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBY2Dzej03A&t=484s&pp=ygUVM0QgZHVuZ2VvbiBnZW5lcmF0aW9u">3D Dungeon Generation video</a>. Please note that the project is still in its early stages.


## Algorithms Used
I've employed several algorithms in this project, including 3D triangulation, minimum spanning tree, shaders, and more. The project is primarily built using the C# language, along with Shaders and the Cinemachine package.

## Planned Features
Here are some of the features planned for the game's development:

- Optimization of the generation algorithm
- Unique mirror and light mechanics
- Elevator systems
- Expansion of room templates
- Introduction of enemies and bosses
- A variety of weapons

Feel free to check out the project's progress and stay tuned for updates!
